# Part--2-MIT-805-Assignment

This project implements a traffic sign detection system using the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset and the DFG Traffic Sign Dataset. The pipeline integrates Big Data preprocessing with Apache Spark (MapReduce) and deep learning with YOLOv5 to build a scalable, real-world traffic sign detection model. The work was developed as part of a university assignment focusing on MapReduce, visualization, and object detection.
